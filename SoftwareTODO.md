# SoftwareTODO

This is just an informal list of things we need to build to get Turaco up and running.  Please feel free to add to it.  Items are in no specific order *yet*.

1. Proper stub methods so stdio support for stdin, stdout works:
  - \_Stub\_write()
  - \_Stub\_read()
2. VT100/ANSI emulation baked into text mode.
  i.e. need a CHAROUT function that respects ANSI escape sequences.
