# Turaco: A 16-Bit Open Source Games Console and Microcomputer

Turaco is a hybrid of an 80s style microcomputer, and an 8-bit games console. It is an open hardware system designed for retrocomputing, featuring a 50MHz eZ80 CPU, 1MB of built-in static RAM, the VERA graphics system, an expansion cartridge slot, SNES compatible gamepad ports, USB keyboard support, and a flexible development environment based on the C programming language implemented in the z88dk toolchain for Windows, macOS, and Linux/BSD.

Turaco is in the design stage. The goal is to produce a reference design and implementation which anyone can use to manufacture and sell Turaco systems.

The schematic is awaiting peer review, before being routed for fabrication and population. Pull requests and issue submission are actively encouraged.
